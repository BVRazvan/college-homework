--------------------E.L.F Executable Loader------------------------------------

    Project's purpose is to load an ELF executable into virtual space using
demand paging mechanism.
    In the beginning, a parse over the executable is required in order to
define each section(segment). Once finished, executable file has everything it
needs to run.
    To provide demand paging mechanism, a handler for SEG_FAULT signal is
implemented in skel-lin/loader/loader.c file. The handler modifies default
action of this signal in the following manner:
        -finds the segment which contains the address raising the signal;
        -checks if the page raising the signal is not mapped and acts properly;
        -maps the page causing the signal into virtual address space;
        -checks if segment's memory size is larger then actual size(e.g. bss)
and fill with zero inside the page(if it is the case);
        -loads segment's structure into virtual page.
