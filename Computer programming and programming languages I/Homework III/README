	First of all, there are two main structs, both used for mentaining details
about the photos, one is of type char and the other double(the second one is 
used for applying filters).

	For reading the input I use fgets() in order to get the commands line
by line. After that I use strtok() to get the command's name. In the end I
check if this command exists in set and apply them in some cases.

	Now, I will try to discuss about each command particularly.

--------------------------------LOAD----------------------------------

	Initially I check if there is any image loaded. Next, I open the image
for reading the type, dimensions and max_value(255). Using the functions
check() and skip() I handle the case when I find lines which are commentaries.
Having image's type, I reopen the image accordingly and read matrix's elements.

--------------------------------SELECT--------------------------------

	Initially I check if there is any image loaded. Next, using strtok()
I verify if next word is "ALL" or a set of coordinates. In the second case
I have to read the coordinates using parsing, handling at the same time and
other characters than digits("-", letters). Later on, I verify if the
coordonates are included into the photo's dimensions.

-------------------------------ROTATE---------------------------------

	Initially I check if there is any image loaded. Next, I read angle's
value using strtok(). There is a key observation which allows us to handle
just the cases of 90,180 and 270 degrees angles because we can take all angles
modulo 360 and negative angles can be treated as posivite ones by extracting
them from 360. Later on, we rotate the photo accordingly, depending on the
shape(square/rectangle).

--------------------------------CROP---------------------------------

	Initially I check if there is any image loaded. Next, I change photo's
dimensions depending on selected coordonates. In the end I just copy the
selected elements in the new photo.

-------------------------------APPLY---------------------------------

	Initially I check if there is any image loaded. Next, I read filter type
using strtok(). If the filter is into set, I multiply the selected submatrix
with the matrix of effects.

------------------------------SAVE------------------------------------

	Initially I check if there is any image loaded. Next, I copy the matrix
used for operations(apply/crop/rotate/etc) into the matrix of chars.
After that I check the type of the matrix(color/noncolor) in order to
save it(binary/ascii text).

------------------------------EXIT-----------------------------------

	Initially I check if there is any image loaded. Next, I deallocate the
memory used for the program.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

	It is worth mentioning that I check after each command if any allocation
failed(function F()).
